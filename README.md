- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dimitris Pouliasis and i'm from Greece.Î™'m a self taught programmer who started learning programming concepts when i first came across blockchain technology.

      As soon as i realized the potential and how significant it can turn out to be in the near future my decision was imminent.I wanted to get involve!

      As part of my personal research i found out about smart contracts and solidity programming language.I found out some coding tutorials and bootcamps and i started writing code.

      As such, i have made a small portfolio of decentralized applications(dapps) whcih are presented in the projects section.
      I hope that they can help me jump start mhy career as a blockchain developer and show things that i have worked on.

      I know that i have a lot of things to learn but as a person who has never coded before and has no academic background of that kind i think that it clearly shows my will and desire to learn to code.
      With proper guidance and education i believe i  can prove to be a valuable asset in this fast evolving industry for every employer.

      Thank you for taking the time to read this.

      Kind regards,
      Dimitris Pouliasis
